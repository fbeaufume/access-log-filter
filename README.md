# Spring Boot access log filter

This repository is a sample application for my [Spring Boot access log filter](https://beaufume.fr/articles/access-log-filter/) article.

This simple Spring Boot web application shows how to write an HTTP access log filter.

Start the application using your IDE or with `mvn spring-boot:run`, then open `http://localhost:8080/date`
or `http://localhost:8080/secured-date` (with `john.doe` username and `password` password) and then see the application logs.
